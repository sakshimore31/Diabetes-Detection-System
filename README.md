# Diabetes-Detection-System
Overview
The Diabetes Detection System is a machine learning-based application built using Python and Django to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on medical input parameters. The system utilizes a trained ML model to analyze patient data and provide predictive insights, assisting in early detection and preventive care.

Features
✅ User-Friendly Interface – Developed using Django for seamless interaction.
✅ Machine Learning Integration – Utilizes scikit-learn for diabetes prediction.
✅ Data Processing – Uses pandas and numpy for efficient data handling.
✅ Interactive Dashboard – Displays predictions, statistics, and insights.
✅ Secure & Scalable – Implements Django backend for data management.

Technologies Used
Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (for UI)
Backend: Django (Python)
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
Database: SQLite3 (or MySQL, PostgreSQL if configured)
How It Works
User inputs medical details (e.g., glucose levels, BMI, age, etc.).
The system processes the data and applies a trained ML model.
The prediction result is displayed, indicating the risk level.
